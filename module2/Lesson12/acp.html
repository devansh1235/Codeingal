    <h1> My Nepal Trek Diary </h1>

    <div class="fixednote">
        Quick Route:
        Kolkata to NJP to Mirik to Dhotre to Tumling to Jawbari to Back to Kolkata
    </div>

    <div class="day1">
        Day 1 - Kolkata to Mirik
        The day started early with the Vande Bharat.
        NJP was crowded as always, but the car ride up felt peaceful.
        Mirik welcomed us with cool air and a quiet lake.
        We walked around lazily and ended the day with hot momos.
    </div>

    
    <div class="day2">
        Day 2 - Mirik to Dhotre and Trek to Tumling
        We left after breakfast and the road to Dhotre slowly turned green and silent.
        The trek started gently, with tall trees and mist waiting for us.
        The climb was tiring but comforting.
        Tumling appeared like a small cluster of homes on top of the world.
    </div>

    
    <div class="day3">
        Day 3 - Waking Up in Tumling
        Morning light made everything feel unreal.
        Clouds floated below us and the wind carried a kind of stillness.
        We walked around without any plan, stopping whenever we felt like it.
    </div>

   

    <div class="day4">
        Day 4 - Trek to Jawbari
        The trail to Jawbari was quiet and simple.
        Prayer flags moved gently in the wind.
        A few dogs walked with us like they knew us.
        We found a spot to sit for a long time and later returned for more momos.
    </div>

    
    <div class="day5">
        Day 5 - Heading Back
        Leaving felt difficult.
        We packed slowly and took one last look at the hills.
        The ride to NJP was quiet.
        Back in Kolkata, everything looked normal, but the trip stayed with us.
